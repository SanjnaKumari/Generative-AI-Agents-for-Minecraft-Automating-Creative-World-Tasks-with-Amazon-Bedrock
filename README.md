# Generative AI Agents for Minecraft: Automating Creative World Tasks with Amazon Bedrock  

## Project Overview  
This project aims to develop an **AI-powered assistant** for Minecraft that automates world-building and gameplay elements using **natural language commands**. Leveraging **AWS Bedrock**, our system allows players to generate structures, landscapes, and interactive elements seamlessly, reducing the time and effort required for server creation.  

## Motivation  
Building detailed Minecraft worlds from scratch is time-consuming and requires advanced skills. Many new server owners, content creators, and educators struggle with creating immersive environments efficiently. Our AI agent **solves this problem** by enabling users to generate and modify Minecraft worlds instantly, making server management easier and more accessible.  

## Project Goals  
- **Automate world-building** with AI-generated landscapes and structures.  
- **Enhance multiplayer experiences** by enabling AI-driven minigames and events.  
- **Support content creators** by allowing quick generation of custom game environments.  
- **Assist educators** in creating interactive learning experiences in Minecraft.  

## Technology Stack  
- **AWS Bedrock (Nova Lite)** – AI-powered natural language processing.  
- **Mineflayer API** – Integrates AI commands into Minecraft’s server environment.  
- **Node.js & JavaScript** – Backend development for AI-Minecraft interaction.  

## Project Scope & Limitations  
- The AI agent will be trained for **Creative Mode** tasks (e.g., building, modifying landscapes).  
- **Single AI model usage** to keep AWS costs minimal.  
- Optimization will focus on **efficiency and low-latency processing** within Minecraft servers.  

## Team Members & Roles  
- **Faraz Ulhaq Shah** – AI integration & AWS Bedrock setup.  
- **Taeesh Azal Assadi** – Model training & natural language processing.  
- **Sanjna Kumari** – Backend development & Minecraft server interaction.  

## AWS Usage & Budget  
We estimate **5-10 million tokens per month** using **AWS Bedrock (Nova Lite)**, keeping the cost **under $6 per month**. Optimizations will ensure minimal resource consumption while maintaining AI performance.  

## GitLab Repository  
All project-related documents, source code, and updates will be maintained in our **GitLab repository**. A structured `README.md` and documentation will ensure clear project tracking.  

## Future Work & Expansion  
- Enhancing AI to handle **more complex gameplay mechanics**.  
- Expanding support for **procedural terrain generation**.  
- Exploring **multimodal AI integration** for richer interactions.
